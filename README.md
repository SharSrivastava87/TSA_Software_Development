# Cypress Connect 
## Software Development at Fort Worth, Texas

Cypress Connect is a tool to help improve student involvement at Cypress Ranch High School.

## Research about the problem:
Introduction:

Attendance is an important factor in any educational or community event. It serves as a gauge of success and helps determine how effective the event was in reaching its intended audience. However, in recent years, there has been a decrease in student attendance at both school and community events. This decline is a concern as it can have a negative impact on the success of an event and limit the opportunities available to students.

Causes:

There are several factors that may contribute to the decrease in student attendance. One factor is the increasing use of technology. With the rise of online learning, students may be more inclined to stay at home and access the material online rather than attending in-person events. Social media and other digital distractions may also divert students' attention away from attending events.

Another factor is the lack of interest or relevance to students. Many events may not be tailored to students' interests or may not align with their schedules or priorities. This may lead to a lack of motivation or a feeling that the event is not worth attending.

In addition, there may be external factors that affect attendance, such as transportation or financial barriers. These barriers may prevent students from attending events that are further away from their homes or require additional expenses.

Impact:

The decrease in student attendance can have a significant impact on the success of an event. It may limit the number of participants and reduce the overall engagement of the audience. This, in turn, can affect the overall impact and effectiveness of the event, limiting the opportunities available to students.

In addition, decreased attendance may lead to a reduction in funding for events. Funding organizations may view low attendance as a lack of interest or engagement, which may lead to a reduction in funding for future events.

Solutions:

There are several strategies that can be employed to address the issue of decreased student attendance. One approach is to increase the relevance of the event to students. This can be done by identifying the interests and needs of the student population and tailoring events to align with those interests.

Another strategy is to improve communication and promotion of events. Schools and communities can utilize social media and other digital platforms to reach out to students and increase awareness of upcoming events.

Transportation and financial barriers can also be addressed through the provision of resources such as transportation vouchers or subsidies for students who may not have access to these resources.

Conclusion:

The decrease in student attendance at school and community events is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach. By addressing the underlying causes of decreased attendance and employing strategies to increase engagement and relevance, schools and communities can promote greater attendance and ensure the success of their events.

## Description of the project

Our project was designed to address the issue of decreased student attendance at school and community events. After conducting research and identifying the underlying causes of the problem, we recognized the need for a solution that would motivate students to attend events and increase their engagement.

To achieve this, we created a point system website that incentivizes students to attend events and earn points. The website was designed to be user-friendly and accessible to all students, regardless of their technological proficiency.

The point system works by assigning a certain number of points to each event. Students can earn these points by attending the event and checking in using their school ID or other identifying information. The more events a student attends, the more points they can earn.

To add an additional layer of motivation, we also offer rewards to students who accumulate a certain number of points. These rewards can include anything from gift cards to school merchandise, and are intended to further incentivize students to attend events and engage in their school community.

In order to ensure the success of the point system website, we worked closely with school administrators and event coordinators to identify the events that would be most relevant and engaging to students. This allowed us to tailor the point system to align with student interests and encourage greater attendance and engagement.

Overall, our point system website has been successful in increasing student attendance at school and community events. Students have reported feeling more motivated and engaged in their school community, and administrators have seen an increase in event attendance and overall engagement. We believe that our project has the potential to be implemented in other schools and communities, helping to address the issue of decreased student attendance and promote greater engagement among students.

An admin user who is logged in can create a dynamic QR code for any event by visiting the following URL:
```http://<host>:<port>/event-qr/<event ID>```

#### Note: By using dynamic QR codes, we ensure that students cannot share links with other students to gain points without attending events as each link is only valid for a short period of time

### Creating database backups

```shell
python manage.py dbbackup
```

### Restoring database backups

```shell
python manage.py dbrestore
```

#### Note: If you are restoring a database containing relations you may need to run the above command twice.

#### Note: This will overwrite the current database with the backup.
